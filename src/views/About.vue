        <h1>Surviving 2020 together ...</h1>
        <p>Now more than ever, the entire world is connected by one single thing. While this platform does not provide a cure for the virus, healing for those mourning or medicine for the sick, it was built in the hopeS that we will continue to feel even more connected. You are seen, you are felt and you are heard. <br><br> There will come a time when we will look back in wonder. But until then, we will stand together and overcome. I hope this inspires someone! </p>
